<h4>Pending users</h4>
<p>Each Twebz user needs to be created by an admin. Once a user is created,
  they will be able to manage multiple Twitter accounts with Twebz. The CouchDB 
  user name has nothing to do with their Twitter user name. The user will log
  into CouchDB as the CouchDB user, and then CouchDB will delegate connecting to 
  Twitter to send and retreive tweets.</p>
  <ul>
    {{#users}}
      <li><form>{{name}}
        <input type="hidden" name="username" value="{{name}}">
        <input type="submit" value="Setup">
      </form>
      </li>
    {{/users}}
  </ul>

<p>This step can only be completed by an admin. Clicking "setup" will create a 
  database that only the user, and the Twebz application can access. This will
  store private information used for communicating with Twitter. Once this step
  is complete, the user can continue by linking Twitter accounts to Twebz.</p>
