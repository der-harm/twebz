<h4>Create App User</h4>
<p>Twebz requires a dedicated user for the application, which will have access 
  to a Twebz configuration database. To proceed with setup, copy the Twebz configuration code below, then click 
  "setup". Setup will create a user called <tt>{{app_user}}</tt> and grant it access to 
  a configuration database called <tt>{{config_db}}</tt>.
 Save the <tt>{{app_user}}</tt> user's password to a 
  configuration file located at <tt>node/config.json</tt> in the Twebz CouchApp root. 
  This permits the Node.js compontent of Twebz to access 
  configuration data allowing it to communicate with Twitter. Once this step is 
  complete you will be prompted to acquire Twitter authentication keys,
  which takes just a moment on Twitter's API page.</p>
<form><p>Copy this passcode and paste it into the file <tt>node/config.json</tt>: 
  <strong class="password">{{password}}</strong></p>
   <p>Once the passcode is in place, click this button to continue: 
     <input type="submit" value="Setup Twebz User"></p></form>
