<p>Before you can send tweets from Tweb, there some configuration that needs to 
  happen.</p>
<p>Tweb uses a Node.js program to interact with the Twitter API. The README 
  file describes how to install and run the Node.js Tweb program. You may
  have even started running it already. If so, it can pull realtime search results into
  the Tweb database already, but it needs more help to pull in your personalized 
  timeline, or to let you post to Twitter.</p>
<p>The first step is to setup an application key for your installation of Tweb.
  You'll only need to do this once, no matter how many users you allow to sign up 
  for your copy of Tweb. </p>
