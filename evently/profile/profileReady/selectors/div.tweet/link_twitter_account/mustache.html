<h4>Link your Twitter account</h4>
<p>If you were logged in as an admin to setup a CouchDB user for Twebz, 
  now is the time to log out, and log back in as the CouchDB user you
  want to link to Twitter. <strong>TODO we can automate logout</strong></p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> in another window,
  and make sure you are logged in as the account you'd like to add to Twebz.</p>
