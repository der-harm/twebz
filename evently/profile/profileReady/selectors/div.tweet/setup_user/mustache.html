<h4>Setup a new user</h4>
<p>Each Twebz user needs to be created by an admin. Once a user is created,
  they will be able to manage multiple Twitter accounts with Twebz. The CouchDB 
  user name has nothing to do with their Twitter user name. The user will log
  into CouchDB as the CouchDB user, and then CouchDB will delegate connecting to 
  Twitter to send and retreive tweets.</p>
<form><label>Enter the name of the CouchDB user to setup: 
  <input type="text" name="username" value="{{name}}"></label>
  <input type="submit" value="Setup Twebz Account">
  {{#error}}
  <span class="error">Error: {{error}}</span>
  {{/error}}
  </form>
<p>This step can only be completed by an admin, but you can setup Twebz for any 
  CouchDB user. Before we do any work, we'll make sure the user actually exists,
  so don't stress about typos. Clicking "setup" will create a database that only 
  the user, and the Twebz application user, can access. This will be used to store
  some private information used for communicating with Twitter.</p>
