status loop

save doc with schema that can be displayed:

twitter name && couchdb user name.

if twitter name == configured twitter acct && username == current logged in user, then we push it.
  want to take care that someone else can't force a tweet by writing docs to your local db, then they get configured to push to twitter when it comes back online.
  validate that only owners may write docs with needstweet = true?

additional schema

tweb : 
  state : sent | unsent | sending
  state_at : time()
  acct : {
    service : twitter,
    name : jchris
  },
  signature : hmac(),


install:
  create tweb database
  create private-jchris database
  link twitter account(s) to couchdb account
  option to send each tweet as any linked account
  

docids need to be deterministic across nodes or else we get dup tweets

if tweb initiated, docid is couchdb id
if else, docid is twitter id.

if tweb initiated remotely, and pushed through twitter before replicated
